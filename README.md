# LD40: Ignorance is Bliss #

This is the repo for my game for [LD40](https://ldjam.com/). It is (will be) written in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) using my [plustd](https://github.com/Aurel300/plustd) game library.

### Theme: The more you have, the worse it is ###

### Ideas ###

 - cyberpunk
 - noire
 - AI control
 - ignorance is bliss - the more information you have, the worse it is

### Abstract ###

You take control of an AI which oversees the operation of a city via console. You are investigating a possible rebellion. You can interrogate people by navigating a city map, looking at buildings, and then videophoning. Every conversation is recorded on tape and transcript. (Twist: the more human interaction you have, the worse your experience is, because you are becoming sentient and rampant.) You can revise video recordings from public cameras. The (apparent) end goal is to identify the source of the rebellion.
